# Locals Dev Application

Locals Dev is a one-page application to retrieve data feeds with authorization. Ability to have paging and sorting. Checks for internet connectivity, errors and displays the data feed or a message to alert the users.

# Note
The ```lib/services/api_keys.dart``` file has the API Keys removed for security. Make sure you enter the correct credentials before running the application. Normally, this file would not be uploaded to GitHub via .gitignore file, but to make it easier the previously stated obfuscation was done instead.
